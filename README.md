# C-UFO_app

This is a C# console app designed to create a custom data set of UFO sightings from a data set taken from NASA of documented sightings from 1949 onwards. The app offers the functionality to add a sighting, remove sightings based upon a series of criteria, update entries then query the original data set to narrow down the results. The program creates C# objects with 10 attributes though largely bases manipulation around city, state, country or dates. The querying is done through system.linq. The program reads in a csz and prints the custom data to the console as well as the original csv to show only the customized data set.
